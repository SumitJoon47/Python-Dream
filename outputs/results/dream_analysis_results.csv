"I had a dream that was worth recording that I can remember in about a week, or maybe even two weeks. Anyway, last night I had a dream.

And we convinced them to give us an elevator key so that we could get on it. We got on it and we said, ""I wonder what's up on the tenth floor?"" So we went up to the tenth floor, and this elevator had a blue interior, and we got out -- or we didn't get out -- it was this very dark, closed-in room with light-up stained glass murals on the walls. One was like a map of the world with red continents, another was like something really abstract. So we decided, ""Nah, let's not stay up here. Let's go down to the below-ground level and see what's down there."" And I thought, ""Oh gosh."" I hung onto the railing in the elevator as we descended, almost like a bullet, we hit bottom, and the door opened, and I was expecting it to be as dark as anything, but it was a banquet, luncheon hall and there were people having their lunch in there. And Andrea stepped out of the elevator and was going to go spy on them. But then I was up last night, and I had a dream that her and I were with some other people, and oh, she came by to say sorry that she hadn't called me any more, and she wanted to go through a box of jump with me.

And then she and her family and I were at the beach and we were diving in this cave, and they were saying, ""Oh, look at this, oh, look at that."" And it was pitch dark, and so I was feeling around and there were these like huge tarantula things swimming in the water and big sharks with scaly fins.

And then we crossed the hall, we got on another elevator that was kind of average. It had a dark floor. We rode up two floors on that one. And when we got off, we were on the roof.

"I had a dream that our receiver wasn't working and that my father got all upset and decided that he didn't want anything to do with it. And so my mother and I were going to fix it by ourselves. And we started working on it, and we got the front left and right channels to work just fine, but no matter what we did, we could not get the rear section to work. And we had a movie on pause while we were doing all of this. And then somehow I ended up at the Homecoming dance and I was on the second floor of the main building looking out into the courtyard with Ms. Richardsand Ms. Salazarand we were talking about an overhead projector that was rolling through the courtyard to somebody's class, and then I told them I had to go down and go to the dance. And I was at the dance and it was hot, in the bright sun in the middle of the day in the courtyard, and there was a girl named Janice that was sitting at the sound board and her and I would talk. I had a dream that I was on a ship, of all things. And that we were going up and down and up and down long, narrow staircases with a bunch of my friends, and I was seeing alarm boxes everywhere, like fire alarm boxes.

"Last night's dreams are a little fuzzy in my mind. I remember living somewhere seemingly far away from my own home- most likely somewhere in the country, but I don't really remember any buildings. I remember meeting two girls there who I thought I had met once previously (in dreams, I guess, maybe the same night). For some reason I wanted to be really friendly with them, and I felt some kind of personal attachment. I don't remember much about them, except that they lived far away (Although it seemed I was far away from home, I think they were even further), and I wanted to keep contact with them. Then, I was away from them for some reason, and I was thinking of things I wanted to ask them next time I saw them, such as if I could have their address/email address and if they wanted to stay ""friends forever"". Then, when I went to look for them, they were gone- just left, gone back home. At that time I was in a house that very much resembled my grandfather's house (dreams are weird in that you always know something looks familiar, but can only guess if that wasn't what it was supposed to be, or if you really did make that connection in the dream). There was a small van (it was definitely the same van we went to the college Model UN in), and I saw someone get inside, Mr. Rosetti I think. And as far as I knew, we were going into the city for a school trip. On the van (which seemed more like a really big, fancy bus when I got in there), there was a guy lecturing us about something. I was so tired, half-asleep within my dream; and it was a weird situation. It was kind of like a partial dream within a dream. The lecturer asked a question, and in my ""dream"" I imagined I knew the answer so I raised my hand, and when he finally called on me, I said I didn't know the answer, and I only raised my hand because I was half asleep and I imagined either I knew the answer or that he was asking a different question.

"I remember being in Africa- a quiet wooded scene outdoors. I think it was a school trip. It was night, and it was rather warm and the air felt humid.

"I dreamed I was walking through the middle of New York City, yet it didn't really look too much like a city. There weren't enough tall buildings and people. I came to this area with a bunch of homeless kids, and one of the boys asked me if I'd be willing to trade a dollar for a quarter. After looking into my pocket I found I had several hundred dollars with me, so I gave him my dollar. I told him he could keep the quarter but he gave it to me anyway. There was a girl, who upon seeing a bowl on top of a trailer, wondered if there was any food in it. Unfortunately, I had to answer that there wasn't any food in the bowl. Then the idea came to me that I could take her out of that ghetto area, I could show her a better life, and we could have some fun. So I asked her if she'd like to come with me, and I admitted I had some money. She said she would. For some reason one of her friends came with us too. We were walking, and I decided to ask for her telephone number. She gave me a really weird answer, although it did start with my area code; it was something like: 611-832f-9,dt. I told her I didn't know there was a comma on the telephone, and she told me she didn't either (after looking at the telephone, I found it was one of five or six symbols below the ""0"" key). She told me that was the number for her dorm, or something like that, but I didn't even think that she's homeless and probably wasn't old enough to go to college. I lost sight of her at one point and decided to call her on one of the many nearby phones. Of course, when I called the number you can expect that I'm not really calling a telephone, I'm calling HER- that is, the nearest telephone to her would probably ring. But I guess just about when I picked up the phone, she came into view and I told her I'd been looking for her. So, then we went to the amusement park, and got on a ride where you're sitting down, up to your waist in water. I don't know what the ride was supposed to do. But at that point, the girl (if, in fact, I did know her name, it was probably Julia, because that's the first name that comes to mind when I thought of her), the girl started floating in the air. It seemed a rather normal experience, and I said, ""Oh, no, how do we stop her from floating?"" I don't remember what happened after that, except that she was gone. Then, just outside the amusement park, there was a computer, a very eccentric type of computer. I was typing song lyrics into the computer. They were my own song lyrics, and I was amazed that I was typing really good lyrics without really thinking about what I was typing. I often try to write song lyrics in real life, but they never sound just right, even though I think deeply about what I'm going to write. But here, miraculously, these perfect song lyrics were being typed out by me (I'm not sure how good they would have sounded if I heard them in the physical world). There was an interesting little program on this computer that allowed me to integrate the lyrics into an actual song, just by pressing a button. The lyrics sounded excellent when put to music- in fact, I think the voice I heard singing my lyrics was none other than Steven Page, lead vocalist for Barenaked Ladies.

"My first memory was seeing this blonde girl that looked familiar. When I asked for her name, she said Michelle, and I playfully jumped on her. When she acted surprised, I said, ""Oh, sorry, I thought you were another Michelle."" She said her name was Michelle. (There is a senior at my school with the same last name, but I donÕt know anyone named Michelle.) Yet the name sounded very familiar, even to the point that I checked my old yearbook for someone with that name after I woke up (without success). In my dream, she was probably related to Alex in some way, and she was a shadow at Prep Academy. I wanted her to shadow me, but she went with someone else instead.

"I was walking through a hospital, and there were people on life support. The cords connecting them to the support went through the only place that I could walk through, and since the lights were rather low, I was afraid I might accidentally knock out one of the plugs, or someone might trip on them. Then there were 2 teachers, Mrs. Pappas and Mr. Dell. I think Mrs. Pappas told me to turn a dial or press a button, but I didn't hear whether she said DON'T press the button, or press it. I didn't know what the button was for, but I thought it might have some crucial consequence if I didn't follow her directions. So I called her, as she was walking away, and she didn't answer. Mr. Dell was walking behind her, so I called Mr. Dell, and he said he'd get Mrs. Pappas to come back to tell me what to do, but she never did, as far as I remember. Then I remember sitting at a table, probably outside, and eating, with Mrs. Saint and some others. All I remember is that I couldn't hear much, and I had to keep asking these kids at a nearby table to repeat what they were saying to me- when I did, some people just laughed and told me to forget it, but I really wanted to know what they were talking about.

I just remember thinking that it's so easy to run in a dream without getting out of breath, and how fun running is in dreams. Although it looked a lot like my town, I get a feeling at some point I was a long way from my hometown. I just remember asking someone where the bank was. Since I knew I was dreaming, I wanted to rob a million dollars from the bank and ""play liar liar"" was what I called it (I don't exactly understand why, except that in the movie ""Liar Liar"" Jim Carey played the part of a lawyer who couldn't tell the truth).

Again, if I really knew I was dreaming, I would have known that I didn't need money in the dream world and just done whatever I wanted. Oh, there were also a few things about lucid dreaming I thought up, during my dream. I remember thinking, at one point during my dreaming, ""I wonder if I can hypnotize myself while I'm dreaming so I'll be different in some way when I wake up,"" and someone told me that thinking of some of your idiosyncrasies in real life will make your dream stronger when it's fading.

"I dreamed I was in a big room, with lots of people. There were tables, but I didn't see any food. Bernice was there, and there is a brief sexual scene between us. I guess we were in school, or at a school event, because after that, I was very afraid that everyone had seen and that I could be kicked out of school. I pretended the whole thing was ""a show,"" walking around to every table asking everyone ""how do you like the show?"". I didn't feel like anyone was there at the time. I felt ""they"" were looking for me, and would catch me any minute. Then there was a girl who I sat next to, and told her what a surprise, that I'll love her forever (and I don't just say those things, believe me, I really mean them. I sound like Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye, I know- but I know exactly how that kid felt). Then I heard somebody call my name, and I knew I'd be in huge trouble. The strange thing, though, is that it wasn't my name. I can't remember what they called me, but it seemed natural like it was really my name. So, I brought this girl through the nearest door and downstairs. I kept telling her to run faster, but I didn't run away because I felt safer with her around. As far as I remember, I got out. Then, I remember thinking I had woken up, and coming outside my house to see a school bus in my driveway. I thought the bus might have been from my dream, and realized in that case it could have been from anywhere in the world. I looked at the location on the side, and it said it was from somewhere in CA, which, instead of making it out to mean ""West Coast,"" I thought it meant ""Central America.""

"All my family members were out of character: my grandfather was setting up a marriage between myself and someone I've never met. I really didn't want to do it, but I wanted to know if I might possibly have known that person, and I was extremely curious as to what the whole thing was about. I was promised we'd go out to eat afterwards, if it got over early enough. It didn't- I don't think she ever showed up (I never expected her to), and I was upset- I had my mind set on a certain restaurant, and when I found out we had to eat at home, I was furious. Then, we were at home and my family went out for something. I remember trying to make strawberry milk while they were gone- I started using hot water from the faucet, and then when I realized it was regular milk, not meant to be hot, I tried to turn on the cold water but the coolest it got was luke warm. I didn't want them to catch me making strawberry milk, although my brother was there. Then, my family was home, and I noticed I was naked, so I grabbed a towel from the doorknob before they walked into the door. (Then, I was in my kitchen. It was night, and being slightly lucid at this time, I asked my mother to teach me telekinesis. Then, I also mentioned wanting to learn to materialize objects in a dream. She tried to teach me how to open and close the cabinet door without touching it. Also, she gave me a ""magic paintbrush"" that would change pictures and writing on paper, automatically. I asked about real things and I was amazed that it worked from a distance. (But now, I remember all it did was add small stars to the cabinet door. I wasn't thinking of anything to reproduce at that time, so that might be the problem.) So, at that time I left the door with my paintbrush (which I never used again). I didn't really like the idea of a paintbrush- I would rather have just learned to close my eyes to materialize something. Anyway, I was soon in a strange land that looked more like a game reality than real life. I was starting to feel completely lucid. I asked myself some questions about my waking life, but I couldn't think of which questions to ask. There was this part of the environment that was underwater- you'd have to open a door and swim into it. Amazingly the water didn't drain out into the other room (I guess it wasn't so amazing at the time). As I swam through the area, a voice said, through an intercom: ""At this point, the water is only about 8 feet deep, which is exceedingly low compared to the rest of the ocean."" is a good paraphrase. It did look a lot like an ocean- lots of underwater plants and creatures. On the other side, I saw my cousin. I told her she was dreaming, and she said, ""No, I'm not."" I gave her reasons to believe it was a dream. Then I said, ""Can people fly?"" ""Yeah,"" she said. Someone else jumped about 3 inches into the air, trying to demonstrate. I thought they might have thought I meant ""in an airplane"" or something like that. So I said, ""watch"" and I flew about 3 or 4 feet into the air, as easy as can be, and came down. Then, after running out of things to say, and reasons why she could be in a dream, I told her, ""Here, think about it, and if you end up realizing you're in a dream, when you wake up CALL ME."" Then I patted her on the back, and left. I came to this place with a lot of seats, and a lot of people. Then I came to this really cute, little black girl who might have just been sitting down, but I thought was in a wheelchair. I thought I knew her, and she thought the same. I kissed her on the cheek and asked her how she was. She asked me why I came back. I didn't really understand what she was asking (I thought maybe she was mistaking me for someone else), but I told her, ""to see family and friends."" Then I told her, ""You're one of my best friends in the worldÉ no, you ARE my best friend."" And I promised her I'd be back to spend more time with her. At that point I felt like I knew her. Then, I was walking and I remember feeling slightly dizzy in the head. Everything was still very clear, but I could tell I was losing consciousness and wouldn't be in the dream much more than a few seconds. So I sat on the ground and took hold of a table.

"(04/21/2000)[this is a dream] I think I woke up on a couch with several people I knew from school. I was still hearing music in my head from the ""dreams,"" and it wasn't completely pleasing me. I talked to Frank about it, and he asked me if I was hearing the ""beating trumpets"". For some reason, the thought of any instrument with that description- very ominous, ""beating trumpets""- frightened me. I told him yes, because he just brought it up, and he got terribly afraid, curling back in fear. The way in which he did this was actually humorous, when I think about it. He was about to run away, and I was really afraid and needed him with me at that point. I wanted to just relax and watch TV together. I didn't want to be alone so I told him, ok, I'm not hearing the sounds anymore. He came back and I asked, ""Is that music coming from the tv?"" Everyone else thought it was a dumb question. Well, actually everybody laughed, thinking I was joking. I think Warren responded that it was coming from the TV. Then I was in a building that I made out to be the ""QRS Video Store"" and tape rentals were less than $1. I had money to buy one, so I rented a video. I don't remember which one or if I even knew at the time. Next, I'm in a big, old, general or surplus store where most of the place wasn't even being used. There were a couple sections where I could buy CD's, and I'd been wanting to replace my Moxy Fruvous CD that I lost (really) so I thought I'd buy one, but wasn't sure between that and another CD I wanted. Then, on the way back, I'm with my school and we get on this floor space that turns into a whitewater raft. All of a sudden there are like 8 people on the raft, which I made to be way too much. Furthermore, they were mostly people from outside of school. We were diving into the water. They dived over me, and I thought I would drown and not be able to get enough air.",jeff,unknown,04212000this dream think woke up couch several people knew from school still hearing music head from dreams wasnt completely pleasing talked frank about he asked if hearing beating trumpets some reason thought any instrument description very ominous beating trumpets frightened told him yes because he just brought up he got terribly afraid curling back fear way which he did this actually humorous when think about he about run away really afraid needed him point wanted just relax watch tv together didnt want alone so told him ok im not hearing sounds anymore he came back asked music coming from tv everyone else thought dumb question well actually everybody laughed thinking joking think warren responded coming from tv then building made out qrs video store tape rentals less than 1 money buy one so rented video dont remember which one or if even knew time next im big old general or surplus store where most place wasnt even used there couple sections where could buy cds id wanting replace moxy fruvous cd lost really so thought id buy one wasnt sure between another cd wanted then way back im school get this floor space turns into whitewater raft all sudden there like 8 people raft which made way too much furthermore mostly people from outside school diving into water dived over thought would drown not able get enough air,0.10401234567901235,0.35668724279835395,370,"['Water', 'Social']",[],3,1,0.11134830479426511,-0.15212161735437563
"I'm outside, and there's this animal that I think to be a fox. Then I see a little dog that had been beaten up. It looked like a black lab. Then the fox took me by surprise and threw the nearly dead dog on top of me, as if he was taking us both for dead. We were both on the ground. I thought by that by that time the dog was undoubtedly dead, but found that he was still breathing and making noise. I was furious at the fox for doing this to the poor dog. There was a car trying to get through, and I carefully moved the dog to the side of the road. I really didn't think the dog would make it, and I was almost hoping for someone to put him out of his misery but I really wanted to protect the dog and was hoping that he just might be ok. I picked up the fox, who gave a good fight and had claws, but I had to get him away from the dog so he didn't hurt him any more. Then I attempted to throw the fox as far as possible. In the dream, I assumed the fox to be ok anyway, and if I threw him over a fence, he might be hurt just enough so that he didn't go after the dog anymore.

"I was in Vacation State, or so I thought. I was told that this girl, who goes to my school, has a friend who calls herself Stalker Girl and ""she hates the world."" Anyway, I thought she sounded very rebellious. Then I met her. She was nothing like her friend, and she seemed extremely nice to me, different from anyone else I knew and for some reason I just had to follow her. I went outside with her. She had a friend out there, a nice guy with long hair. He told me his name but I couldn't understand what he was saying- sounded like Matthew or Mathais or something beginning with an M. She told me her name too, but I don't remember it. Then she was telling me how she hated this country and everything it consisted of. Then I told her, ""Me too, I mean I hate the country, and the government, but I love the land, I mean the land itself; the actual land is beautiful."" I think she agreed with me. Then we started running, really, really fast. All of a sudden I saw a sign. Since we were in Vacation State I expected it to say ""Welcome to the South,"" but it said ""Welcome to Ohio"". We were running extremely fast, again, at hyper-speed. I thought I saw a ""Welcome to Massachusetts"" sign, and then I saw a sign that said ""Welcome to Alaska"" and I asked her where we were going. She said, ""We're going to make a clone of you to live with us in Kansas, and you can go back home."" My first thought was The Wizard of Oz. I thought we were in a vacation state, but I guess they thought it was Kansas. Then I said ""But I don't want to go home. I want to stay with you; you don't need to clone me.

"I first remember being in a room which I think was a gymnasium, and there were a lot of people there. Then I remember being in a mall, or a toy store of some sort, and there was this girl I knew sitting down and doing something to her hair. I sat down and threw a couple things that were on the table onto her hair. Then, realizing that wasn't exactly what she was trying to do, I cleaned her hair and made sure there was nothing left in it. She asked me if I wanted to get dressed up, and I said I wanted to wear really bright colors and look really crazy, sort of like a motley fool. Then I remember some computers, and a few other people and I were gathered around them. And the girl I was just with- we had been slow dancing without music (the music wasn't really needed). We just sat around, and I don't know what we did. Then she left. I thought she would be gone forever. I started dancing with someone else. Then I found her again, and I just pretended that the other girl didn't exist. I told her I thought I lost her, and I was so happy to find her again, and we started dancing again. The next thing I know, my parents are letting my brother drive me home, which wasn't the best idea. First, he doesn't have a license, and second, during the ride he stood up in the driver's seat, trying to look cool or something. Then, he slowly took his seat belt off like it was some kind of dance move. I was screaming at him to let me out of the car, but he wouldn't. I couldn't think of a way to stop the car without the possibility of getting us in an accident. The next thing I know, we're at home. I told my mother what my brother was doing, and she said he'd be in trouble but didn't appear very angry. Then I saw Clarissa, a girl I go to school with, who I took to be my ex-girlfriend (in this dream). I had a feeling she was upset with me for some reason, so I didn't try to talk to her.

I just knew I'd met her the year before, and then I realized how it didn't seem like a year since the last time I'd seen her.

We went up on the rocks next to the river, and as soon as I saw whitewater people on the water catching up, I started running- I was afraid of what they'd do to us. I think I thought we were in some Asian communist country or something. The land reminded me of Asia, and they were trying to force us all to go whitewater rafting. I was afraid they'd catch us after we ran away from the rafting group. Then I think this girl either disappeared or turned into a boy. Anyway, I think ""he"" showed me a book written by a former Prep Academy student, so I started reading it, and I was very impressed with it. I wanted to show everyone what a great book it was.

"We are on patrol somewhere in Nam. It is not my old unit but the feelings are the same. We are, the infantry lurking in the jungle. As usual we are spread apart, perhaps 4 to 5 meters between each man. The foliage ahead grows less and less dense.; one can see 25· to 30 meters forward, it is somewhat like the better terrain we encountered in Tay Ninh.

Quickly I reload another magazine and pull the trigger. Again nothing, but the others have caught on and the enemy attack seems over. From the background I hear a sharp whining recoil; it is nothing like our 105s or 155s. The number 106 flashes through my mind, though I am not sure if there is such a weapon; perhaps light weapons, but as the shells fall I realize they are undoubtedly heavy artillery. The first explosions fall outside our perimeter; they do not descend like mortars, nor do they explode like artillery. On impact there is a sharp thunder-clap, followed by earth-like clouds of swirling, thick and heavy dust; though it is curious, these manifestations are small and hug the ground. Soon the shells drop closer and' closer to us, and I hear the shrapnel whizzing over. Finally one lands almost on top of me and I imagine a large piece of steel penetrating the flesh of my back.

"We are on a trail, a well-used trail. Any moment, I am ready for an ambush. It seems that 3/6 platoon is drag, as way up in front AK and 16 shots are exchanged. Oddly, at first no one dives to the ground. Instead, we look to see what has happened. Capt. Hylo seems to be standing over a dead dink. Then hell breaks lose. The bamboo surroundings become a barren hilly expanse with dinks about us. They have some sort of modern building on a ledge 100 meters to my right. Way off I see a dink machine gunner beading on us. I open up on him. Then another dink MG appears, closer. I, too, have a machine gun, we will duel with bullets. Who will kill the other first? A dink on the ledge by the building hurls a grenade at me. I am lucky. It is a bit short of its target. I hug the earth and cannot recall being hurt. Next, the dink gunner rolls a base ball grenade towards me. I consider my chances against the time delay, grab it and hurl it a mighty length. It explodes harmlessly in the air. The duel renews.

"I am in a strange sort of bunker. The other day I had been going through an album of family pictures. The bunker is actually the bar in the basement of 39 Ivy Street! I am lying on the counter in a prone position; the atmosphere is one of war. Sandbags and timber abound. The sky is eerily overcast. Bombs begin to fall. Not the mortars of past dreams but rather some kind of heavy artillery. A sharp thunder follows the initial detonation, as if there were some sort of dual explosive, or perhaps a new barrage tactic. I throw myself over and fall to the ground. Cowering under the counter I wait for the inevitable. Within seconds a shell crashes down upon the spot I had occupied and not too hastily vacated.

"We are on the same fire base as the one established in Cambodia. This time I am not with my own platoon but I am part of the TOC/CP. BC(?) Is none other than the young doctor from LZ Green who did not know how to handle his own rank. We meddle about in a huge canvas tent. I think about digging a foxhole but there are no shovels. Night comes. All of a sudden there is a metallic burst of illumination flares. The sky lights up and we are showered by the magnesium brightness. For the first few moments no one knows what is going on. Who has called for the lume? Then, through the thin canvas I see two figures run past about 40 yards off. So, it is a ground attack. But I say nothing. Moments later the AK's open up. In the dream there are several old house where the gooks have holed up. My old platoon and I converge on it. With my M-16 roaring I cut down several dinks. I am overwhelmed by the sight of two individuals fighting with the enemy. Of all people, there is Mike W., our old RTO. I begin to fire, but my M-16 is sluggish; the bullets dumbly chug out. Wilson is followed by Juba, my friend from down the street, a high school buddy (who now I go to bars with every now and then). Juba has a long .45. His long drilling shots come after Wilson sprays me with a burst that catches me flush across the body. Again, though I am obviously hit, nothing happens. The firefight ends. We go back to the tent. I see bullet holes in my ankles. The Captain asks me if there is anything I want. I think of telling him, ""Yes! A Medivac,"" but I say only that we should dig foxholes. The next day I scrounge for ammo. There is little or none to be found, though I steal two grenades. I meet Roop and Melhop. During the fire fight, I use grenades but they prove ineffective. Even though I hold them for two or three seconds after the handle flies off (and they hiss like smoke grenades) they are thrown too hard and bounce away, and oddly, explode in a mere crackle of sparks, the way smoke does when it first ignites. Steve S. (a fellow from sleep away camp) and I go to the other side of the base. There is a small VN compound. Steve S. throws a grenade into a little wooden school house filled with children. It blows up and there are the horrific screams of the wounded. We walk down a trail. I am telling him how stupid he is for making this mess, surely there will be another attack tonight.
